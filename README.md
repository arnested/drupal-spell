# Aspell extra dictionary for Drupal

Run <kbd>M-x drupal-spell-enable</kbd> to setup the Drupal dictionary
as an extra dictionary in that buffer.

The command will be enabled automatically when activating
[`drupal-mode`](https://github.com/arnested/drupal-mode).

## Installation

The easiest way to install Drupal spell is probably to install it via
the ELPA archive at [Marmalade](http://marmalade-repo.org/packages/drupal-spell).

ELPA (package.el) is part of Emacs 24. For Emacs 23 see
[Marmalade](http://marmalade-repo.org) for installation instructions.

### Dependencies

You need to use [aspell](http://aspell.net) as your spell checker as
`ispell` does not support the use of extra dictionaries.

## Development of Drupal spell

Drupal spell is actively developed at
[GitHub](https://github.com/arnested/drupal-spell).  Feature requests,
ideas, bug reports, and pull request are more than welcome!
